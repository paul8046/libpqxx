Build system
(*) Completely support building outside the source directory
(*) Auto-generate up-to-date versions of MinGW makefile
(*) Ensure there is a way to build without -rpath and use that for the
    Debian packaging.

Connections
(*) Separate failed_connection exception type if connection never succeeds?
(*) Connection pooling support
(*) Support scoped/unscoped non-superuser identity (outside transaction only)
(*) libpqxx-level trace output

Cursors
(*) Provide iterator interface
(*) Investigate WITH HOLD feature (nontransaction cursors)
(*) From 7.4, MOVE and FETCH are much improved (PQcmdTuples()!)

Large Objects
(*) Support lo_tell()

Results
(*) Conceive metadata model
(*) Allow direct mapping onto structs, using member ptr template args
(*) Convert to/from date/time values
(*) Real encoding support (PQmblen(), PQenv2encoding())
(*) Support PQftablecol()

Streams
(*) Provide metadata information in tablestream
(*) Support column lists for COPY (create "inserter" class for list)
(*) Allow single-level insertion with endt/endr manipulators

Transactions
(*) German's locking idea for robusttransaction
(*) User schema support for robusttransaction log table
(*) Support SET CONSTRAINTS (no-op for nontransaction).  Make DEFER scoped?
