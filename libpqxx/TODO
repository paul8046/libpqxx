Error handling
(*) Check for unexpectedly open/closed transactions (appears to be possible)
(*) Deal with in-doubt transactions (manual transaction tracking :-( )

General
(*) Rename *.cc to *.cxx to tell MS Visual C++ that they're C++
(*) Decent build instructions
(*) Get object files into obj/ directory

Porting
(*) Port to mySQL etc., then refactor to separate front/back interfaces
(*) Hide DBMS-specific connect string
(*) Make TableStream classes respect DIALECT

Results
(*) Allow querying of field types
(*) Allow direct mapping onto structs, using member ref template args (?)

Streams
(*) Provide metadata information in TableStream
(*) Work streamable (and prefetching!) result sets into Stream hierarchy
(*) Refactor, adding streams that return 1 tuple at a time

Triggers
(*) Allow access to Connection's triggers list?

Nonblocking operation
(*) Support select()
