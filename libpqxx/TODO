Build system
(*) Check for <sstream> presence (and what if it ain't there?)
(*) Completely support building outside the source directory
(*) Ensure there is a way to build without -rpath and use that for the
    Debian packaging.
(*) Switch from dh_movefiles to dh_install for Debian packaging.

Connections
(*) Separate failed_connection exception type if connection never succeeds?
(*) Connection pooling support
(*) Support scoped/unscoped non-superuser identity (outside transaction only)

Cursors
(*) Provide iterator interface
(*) Investigate WITH HOLD feature (nontransaction cursors)
(*) From 7.4, MOVE and FETCH will be much improved (PQcmdTuples()!)

Documentation
(*) Document migration procedures from libpq++

Large Objects
(*) Support lo_tell()

Nonblocking operation
(*) Separate query issuing from receipt of results
(*) Support select()
(*) Split up commits to narrow down in-doubt window

Results
(*) Conceive metadata model
(*) Allow direct mapping onto structs, using member ptr template args
(*) Convert to/from date/time values
(*) Real encoding support (PQmblen(), PQenv2encoding())
(*) Support PQftablecol()

Streams
(*) Provide metadata information in tablestream
(*) Support column lists for COPY
(*) Escape carriage returns in COPY
(*) Allow single-level insertion with endt/endr manipulators

Transactions
(*) German's locking idea for robusttransaction!
(*) User schema support for robusttransaction log table
(*) Support SET CONSTRAINTS (no-op for nontransaction).  Make DEFER scoped?
(*) Support querying of variables (local map is "cache" for session state)
(*) Support constraints definition

Tests
(*) Floating-point tests
