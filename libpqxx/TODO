Build
(*) Somehow get config.h to never clash with other packages
(*) Look at a-a-t.org for alternative build system
(*) Get object files into obj/ directory, library binary into lib/
(*) Finalize license

Check
(*) Move "check" postgres parameters into configure.ac

Error handling
(*) Check whether transaction still open if possible (consistency with backend)

Porting
(*) Make TableStream classes respect DIALECT
(*) Hide DBMS-specific connect string
(*) Port to mySQL etc., then refactor to separate front/back interfaces

Results
(*) Allow querying of field types
(*) Allow direct mapping onto structs, using member ptr template args (?)

Streams
(*) Provide metadata information in TableStream
(*) Work streamable (and prefetching!) result sets into Stream hierarchy
(*) Refactor, adding streams that return 1 tuple at a time

Transactors
(*) Fix "nested typedefs" situation

Triggers
(*) Allow access to Connection's triggers list?

Nonblocking operation
(*) Separate query issuing from receipt of results
(*) Support select()
