Build system
(*) Make new-style headers include "real" headers (with names ending in .hpp)
(*) Check for <sstream> presence (and what if it ain't there?)
(*) Completely support building outside the source directory
(*) Make Makefile translate tutorial to HTML
(*) Separate config.h's for building the library and building clients

Connections
(*) Check for PQfreeNotify() function instead of just PQfreemem()
(*) Separate failed_connection exception type
(*) Connection pooling support
(*) AsyncConnection
(*) Support my "Appendix" pattern (allow client code to add state)?
(*) Support scoped/unscoped non-superuser identity (outside transaction only)
(*) Support constraints definition

Cursors
(*) Splice out absolute positioning logic (requires serializable transaction!)
(*) Splice out forward-only functionality
(*) Provide iterator interface
(*) Prepare for updateable cursors
(*) Fix Visual C++ compile (?)

Documentation
(*) Document migration procedures from libpq++

Large Objects
(*) Support lo_tell()

Nonblocking operation
(*) Separate query issuing from receipt of results
(*) Support select()

Results
(*) Conceive metadata model
(*) Allow direct mapping onto structs, using member ptr template args
(*) Convert to/from date/time values
(*) Real encoding support (PQmblen(), PQenv2encoding())
(*) Support PQftable(), PQftablecol()

Streams
(*) Provide metadata information in tablestream
(*) Support column lists for COPY
(*) Allow single-level insertion with endt/endr manipulators

Transactions
(*) What if robusttransaction reconnects while "in-doubt" attempt still ongoing?
(*) User schema support for robusttransaction log table
(*) Support SET CONSTRAINTS (no-op for nontransaction).  Make DEFER scoped?

Tests
(*) Full test coverage (binarystring, SetVariable)
(*) Floating-point tests

Triggers
(*) Allow access to connection_base's triggers list?
