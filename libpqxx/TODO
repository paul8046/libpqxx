ALERT
(*) Test failure for binary strings with postgres 8.0.2, Fedora!?
(*) test085 fails with postgres 8.0.2, Fedora!?
(*) New distribution archives lack tutorial? (Steve Butler)

All Over
(*) Check for stlport (#ifdef _STLP_STD) to define PGSTD accordingly
(*) Ensure table/column/cursor/... names are always quoted

Build & Configuration
(*) Add -lwsock32 to tools/Makefile.am if needed (MingW!)
(*) Rename libcompiler.h/compiler.h to reduce confusion
(*) Remove ../include/pqxx from libtool include path somehow
(*) Why are the test programs linked with "-lpq -lpq -lpq"!?

Connections
(*) Use PQserverVersion(), if available, to determine backend version
(*) Probe, and cache, backend feature set if needed
(*) Work around pre-7.3 handling of transaction variables?
(*) Make PQprotocolVersion() and/or PQserverVersion() available to public?
(*) Clean up connection state model; factor out connection policy classes
(*) Use PQtransactionStatus to detect auto-aborted transactions?
(*) More helpful broken_connection exception hierarchy
(*) Connection pooling support
(*) Support scoped/unscoped non-superuser identity (outside transaction only)
(*) libpqxx-level trace output

Cursors
(*) Older backends don't have NO SCROLL etc.!
(*) Think about positioning and nested transactions
(*) Investigate WITH HOLD feature (nontransaction cursors)
(*) In PostgreSQL 7.4, MOVE and FETCH are much improved (PQcmdTuples()!)

Documentation
(*) Separate out README troubleshooting sections (parallel to build steps?)
(*) Reduce duplication in reference docs using Doxygen member grouping

Exceptions
(*) Strip newlines from PostgreSQL error messages in exceptions?
(*) Document exception guarantees (weak / strong / poorly defined / pure)

Large Objects
(*) Support lo_tell()
(*) Check for handling of nul characters

Results
(*) Convert to/from date/time values
(*) Splice out a reusable interface definition
(*) Real encoding support (PQmblen(), PQenv2encoding())
(*) Check for handling of nul characters
(*) Support PQftablecol()
(*) Conceive metadata model
(*) Allow direct mapping onto structs, using member ptr template args

Streams
(*) Permit column list test failures on pre-7.3 postgres backends
(*) Provide metadata information in tablestream
(*) Can we have a tablestream that looks more like a result?
(*) Create "inserter" class for column lists
(*) Allow single-level insertion with endt/endr manipulators
(*) Streambuffer class?

Tests
(*) Test with multiple backend versions
(*) Test tablereader and rows ending in empty fields
(*) Test infinities

Transactions
(*) [pgsql 8.0] Create log table "WITH OIDS" if appropriate
(*) [pgsql 8.0] Support two-phase commit with separate transaction class(es)
(*) [pgsql 8.0] Support nested transactions and savepoints
(*) Undefine nontransaction "transaction" variables?
(*) User schema support for robusttransaction log table
(*) Support SET CONSTRAINTS (no-op for nontransaction).  Make DEFER scoped?
(*) Support constraints definition

Util
(*) Report closing of non-open sessionfocus only during explicit close, not dtor
(*) Use NAN macro for floating-point conversions, if available
(*) Support floating-point infinities
