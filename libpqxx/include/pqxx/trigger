/// "Observer" base class for trigger notifications.
/** To listen on a database trigger, derive your own class from trigger and
 * define its function call operator to perform whatever action you wish to
 * take when the given trigger arrives.  Then create an object of that class
 * and pass it to your connection.  DO NOT set triggers directly through SQL,
 * or they won't be restored when your connection fails--and you'll have no
 * way to notice.
 *
 * Trigger notifications never arrive inside a transaction.  Therefore, you
 * are free to open a transaction of your own inside your trigger's function
 * invocation operator.
 *
 * Notifications for your trigger may arrive anywhere within libpqxx code, but
 * be aware that POSTGRESQL DEFERS NOTIFICATIONS OCCURRING INSIDE TRANSACTIONS.
 * So if you're keeping a transaction open, don't expect any of your triggers
 * on the same connection to be notified.
 *
 * Multiple triggers on the same connection may have the same name.
