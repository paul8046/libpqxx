Welcome to libpqxx, a C++ API to the PostgreSQL database management system.

To get started quickly on a Unix-like system, enter:

./configure	# (plus suitable arguments, to set up the build environment)
make		# (to build the library)
make check	# (to run the library's self-test suite)
make install	# (with superuser privileges, to install the library)

Once this has succeeded, you should be able to link your own programs with 
libpqxx.

But first, a word on those "suitable arguments."  These may or may not be
needed on your particular system, so do try omitting them at first.  The most 
important options are:

--with-postgres=<path>
to indicate the base PostgreSQL library and include path.  The build procedure 
expects to find subdirectories include/ and lib/ there.  If, for instance, you
have the PostgreSQL headers and libraries in /usr/local/pgsql/include/ and
/usr/local/pgsql/libs/ respectively, all you need to specify this to the
configure script is "--with-postgres=/usr/local/pgsql".

--with-postgres-include=<path>
to indicate just the PostgreSQL include path.  This is not needed if you use 
the --with-postgres option.  If, for instance, the PostgreSQL headers are not 
in your standard include path but in /usr/include/postgresql/, then what you 
need to specify is "--with-postgres=/usr/include/postgresql".

--with-postgres-lib=<path>
to indicate the path to PostgreSQL's libpq library.  If, for instance, this
library is in /usr/local/postgresql/lib, then you need to specify the configure
option "--with-postgres-lib=/usr/local/postgresql/lib/".

To configure on a RedHat-like system, use "--with-postgres=/usr/local/pgsql".
Debian systems use "--with-postgres-include=/usr/include/postgresql".  If your
system requires a different setting, please let me know.
