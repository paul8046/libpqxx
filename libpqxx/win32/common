# If you are using a 3rd party STL like STLport, remember to check your path
# and be sure the STLport is included before the MSVC includes. VCVARS32.BAT
# doesn't know anything about the directories as defined in the IDE. I use
# set INCLUDE=\Utility\Code\STLport-4.5\stlport;%INCLUDE%
# STD=/D "PGSTD=_STL" 

# Depending on your STL library min/max need to be defined.  Using STLport
# there is no need for libpqxx to redefine these for me.

# The next line gives us the src directory to add additional include directories
# We need certain header files from the Postgres code.  Specifically

#     src/include/postgres_fe.h
