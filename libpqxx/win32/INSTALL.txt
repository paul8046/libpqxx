Welcome to libpqxx, a C++ API to the PostgreSQL database management system.
Please see the regular README for general instructions on building, installing,
and using the library.  If you are using Cygwin, MSYS, or another Unix-like
environment please try the Unix configuration & build procedure instead of the
one described here; some help getting started with MSYS is given below.  Things
are a bit more complicated for Windows systems.

The only Windows compilers currently described in this document are:

	Visual C++ (7.0 or above)
	MinGW

If you are using a different compiler, such as Borland C++ Builder, you should
still be able to get it to work.  If you do, or if you fail, please report your
results so any problems can be resolved and support for the compiler can be
included in the standard libpqxx distribution.

To get started quickly on a Windows system, use the command line.

If you're using Visual C++:
1) Run VCVARS32.BAT to prepare the environment.
2) Edit win32/common to reflect the correct paths to your PostgreSQL includes
   and library files.
3) Create the configuration headers include/pqxx/config-*-*.h.  On a Unix-like
   system these would be generated by the configure script.  How these files
   work is described below; see config/sample-headers for working examples.
4) Now "nmake /f libpqxx.mak ALL" will compile all dynamic, static, debug and 
   release libraries. You will find them in the win32/lib directory.

If you're using MinGW (but without a Unix-like environment, see above):
1) Edit win32/MinGW.mak to reflect the correct paths to your PostgreSQL includes
   and library files.
2) Create the configuration headers include/pqxx/config-*-*.h.  On a Unix-like
   system these would be generated by the configure script.  How these files
   work is described below; see config/sample-headers for working examples.
3) Run "make", using win32/MinGW.mak as the makefile (using a -f or /f option
   to indicate the file, depending on whose version of Make you use).
4) Consider installing a Unix-like environment to automate all this!
   
After that, it is recommended that you compile and run the self-test programs
included in the package.  Unix, Cygwin, or MSYS users simply type "make check"
to build and run the entire regression test.  For Visual C++ users, the
following steps should accomplish the same:

5) "nmake /f test.mak ALL" will compile and link all the test files. It is
   currently set to use the dll version of libpqxx.
6) Make sure a PostgreSQL database is running and accessible; set up the
   environment as described in README so that the test programs can access the
   database without passing a connection string.
7) Run each of the test programs in order.  Some of them will generate lots of
   output, some won't produce any.  Error messages that are expected in the
   course of a normal test run are prefixed with "(Expected)" to show that they
   are not harmful.  All tests should complete successfully.


Getting Started with MinGW and MSYS
(based on contribution by Michael J. Pedersen, 2004-08-17)

MSYS is a Unix-like environment for Windows.  Once you have this installed,
building libpqxx should be a lot more like it is under Unix except that the
locations of libraries and such aren't sufficiently standardized.

Packages to download if you don't have them already:
1) MinGW (http://www.mingw.org/), plus any updates. It is recommended to get all
   of them.
2) MSYS (http://www.mingw.org/), again with any updates. Same recommendation.
3) PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org/).
4) zlib (http://www.zlib.org/). Recommended to get latest version.

Compiling and installing PostgreSQL before you get to libpqxx:
1) Install MinGW (install to c:\mingw)
2) Install MSyS into MinGW structure (c:\mingw)
3) Run MSYS (Start->Programs->MinGW->MSYS->msys)
4) extract, compile, and install zlib
    ./configure --prefix=c:/mingw/local && make && make install
5) Extract and compile postgresql
        ./configure --prefix=c:/mingw/local --with-includes=c:/mingw/local/include --with-libs=c:/mingw/local/lib
        ln -s src/backend/port/tas/dummy.s src/backend/port/tas.s
        ln -s src/backend/port/dynloader/win32.c src/backend/port/dynloader.c
        make && make install
6) Copy psql.exe and libpq.dll to somewhere on your path
7) ln -s /mingw/bin/mingw32-make.exe /mingw/bin/make.exe

Building libpqxx:

        export LDFLAGS=-lws2_32
        ./configure --prefix=c:/mingw/local --disable-shared --enable-static
        make
	make install

If you don't have and don't want to install MSYS, you won't be able to perform
the "./configure" step.  You can build libpqxx without it, but it takes a bit
more work and doesn't build the self-test.  Use the special makefile MinGW.mak
in the win32 directory instead of the regular Makefile, and follow the procedure
described below to use the prefabricated configuration headers enclosed in the
source archive.

Building libpqxx without MSYS:

	# (set up configuration headers, see below)
	export LDFLAGS=-lws2_32
	make -f win32/MinGW.mak
	# (install library, headers and pqxx-config manually on your system)

Having installed libpqxx, when compiling your own programs, use the following
steps (examples only here):

g++ -o myfile.o myfile.cpp `pqxx-config --cflags`
g++ -o myexec myfile.o `pqxx-config --libs` -lws2_32

Note that the linker step (g++ -o myexec) will give a spurious warning
about not knowing how to use the -R flag, but the executable will still
be generated, and work just fine.

Note that the last argument to that linker step MUST be -lws2_32.
Without it, the link will provide errors about undefined references to
select. If it's not the last argument, you will get the same results.
Make sure it's there, and make sure it's last. Trust me, you'll be
happier.


Setting up the configuration headers

Several headers, normally generated by the configure script, define certain
aspects of your compilation environment so that the library can work around
compiler shortcomings, functions missing in older libpq versions, etc.  (Samples
for various compiler and libpq versions can be found in the subdirectory
config/sample-headers, so look there first.)

Each of the aspects mentioned below is represented by a configuration item--a
preprocessor macro that is either #define'd to some value or not defined at all.
Most of the items are of a Boolean nature, i.e.  some feature or workaround is
enabled if the corresponding macro is defined or disabled if the macro is left
undefined.  Note that defining any of these macros to 0 means "true," just like
defining it to 1 or anything else does.  The value 1 is more for convention than
anything else.

Some other items require a meaningful value however, e.g. PGSTD needs to be
defined to the name of the standard namespace (typically std).

At the time of writing, there are 3 of these configuration headers that you
need to concern yourself about, all of which should be created in the
include/pqxx subdirectory:

	config-internal-compiler.h
	config-internal-libpq.h
	config-public-compiler.h


The names contain two variables:

1. Internal or public.  Configuration items that affect the compilation of
your client program are located in the config-public-*.h files (currently only
one file); ones that affect only the compilation of the library itself are kept
in the config-internal-*.h ones and are not included at all when compiling
client programs.  Public configuration items (except PGSTD) are prefixed with
PQXX_ to avoid clashes with macros defined by other code.

2. Autotools-related, compiler-related, or libpq-related.  The autotools items
are of no real interest, but the compiler and libpq ones are different.  The
compiler-related ones describe features and shortcomings of the compiler
environment, such as the availability of the <unistd.h> header or the ability
to compile certain complex C++ language constructs.  The libpq items describe
what features are available in the version of libpq you're compiling against.
At the time of writing, the latter all take the HAVE_... form; defining such a
macro indicates that the corresponding feature is available.

A complete list of configuration items and their categorizations can be found in
the configitems file.  The normal configure script reads the list of items from
include/pqxx/config.h.in and writes them to include/pqxx/config.h, then splits
them up into the five smaller files as directed by the configitems database.

Again, sample versions of these headers for various compilers and libpq versions
can be found in the config/sample-headers/ directory.  Try copying the three
headers for the compiler and libpq version most resembling your own environment
to include/pqxx/ and, if you have any problems compiling with those, editing
them by hand to enable or disable features that appear to be giving you trouble.


Changing the Visual C++ makefile

There are 2 items in this makefile that may need to be changed, all have at
least a little bit of documentation.  All these changes take place in the
separate file "common", which is shared between the regular makefile and the
makefile for the regression test, so you shouldn't get any oddities when
compiling the test cases due to a mismatch in compiler settings.

PGSQLSRC
You will need to change this option.  While we don't actually use the source
files from postgres, some of the header files are necessary.  Set this option
where the src directory of postgres is located.  It can handle it from there.

LIBPATH
This is where the release version of libpq is located.  Refer to the postgres
documentation on building this file if you don't have one.


Troubleshooting

The biggest typical problem for Windows/VC++ users is the need to edit the
configuration headers manually, resulting usually in compile errors, e.g. for
missing header files.  Thus, if you get a compile error, the first places to
look are the config-*-*.h and config-*-*.h files in include/pqxx.

If, for instance, the error states that the header file <sys/select.h> is
missing, you will find a configuration variable called PQXX_HAVE_SYS_SELECT_H,
which should not be set if your system doesn't have sys/select.h.  Remove the
line defining this variable from the configuration header where it is defined
(see the configitems file for a list of locations) and the error should
disappear on the next compilation attempt.

If you have to edit your configuration headers, please send your results to the
author or to the libpqxx-general mailing list so that headers corresponding to
your environment can be included in later libpqxx releases.  Be sure to give a
usable personal name so you can be properly credited in the changelog!

CAUTION: DO NOT try to unset yes/no configuration items by defining their macros
to zero.  A value of zero counts as "yes."  If a macro is defined at all, that
means "yes" (or "true," or "enabled" etc.) regardless of what actual value you
set.  To disable an item, make sure it is not defined at all.
