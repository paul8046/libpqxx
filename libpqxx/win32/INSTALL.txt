Welcome to libpqxx, a C++ API to the PostgreSQL database management system.
Please see the regular README for general instructions on building, installing,
and using the library.

To get started quickly on a Windows system with MSVC7 use the command line.
1) Run VCVARS32.BAT to set the environment.
2) Edit win32/common to reflect the correct paths to your PostgreSQL includes
   and library files.
3) Edit include/pqxx/config.h and include/pqxx/libconfig.h to fit your
   compilation environment, or if you have Cygwin (or another Unix-like set of
   tools), just run the "configure" script found in the main directory.
4) Modify the libpqxx.mak if necessary.  See "Changing the makefile" below.
5) Now "nmake /f libpqxx.mak ALL" will compile all dynamic, static, debug and 
   release libraries. You will find them in the win32\lib directory.
   
To create the test files
5) "nmake /f test.mak ALL" will compile and link all the test files. It is
   currently set to use the dll version of libpqxx.
   
 
--- Changing the makefile
There are 2 items in the makefile that may need to be changed, all have at
least a little bit of documentation.  All these changes take place in the
file "common" so you shouldn't get any oddities when compiling the test
cases due to a mismatch in compiler settings.

PGSQLSRC
You will need to change this option.  While we don't actually use the source
files from postgres, some of the header files are necessary.  Set this option
where the src directory of postgres is located.  It can handle it from there.

LIBPATH
This is where the release version of libpq is located.  Refer to the postgres
documentation on building this file.
