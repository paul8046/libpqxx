  - Built registering/unregistering into Trigger; constructor change!
  - Name() returns std::string

2001-12-16 00:45
 Connection:
  - Added COPY support
 Makefile:
  - Now sets my personal connect string as CONNSTR for regression test
  - Uses test7 to restore events table clobbered in test3
  - Now requires new table "orgevents"
 TableReader:
  - Basic functionality implemented
 TableWriter:
  - Basic functionality implemented
 Test4:
  - Updated comments to reflect new cursor "count" convention
 Test6:
  - Created
 Test7:
  - Created
 Transaction:
  - Added COPY support
 Util:
  - Added FromString() analogous (but opposite) to ToString()

2001-12-12 22:20
 Connection:
  - Uses new Unique<> template for m_Trans
 TableReader:
  - Created
 TableStream:
  - Created
 TableWriter:
  - Created
 Transaction:
  - Now checks for active stream
  - Destructor catches Abort() exceptions
 Util:
  - Introduced Unique<> class template

2001-12-02 20:30
 All:
  - Inlined more functions
 Connection:
  - Misc. query functions added

2001-12-02 17:30
 Connection:
  - ProcessNotice() to call (possibly client-defined) notice processor
 Transaction:
  - Now calls notice processor when it can't throw exceptions
  - Checks for pending triggers before it begins
 Trigger:
  - Guarantees that no notifications are delivered inside transactions

2001-12-02 16:00
 Makefile:
  - check target now depends on executables
  - Passes more interesting "count" argument to test4
 Connection:
  - MakeEmpty() to create empty result set
  - Stricter error checking on opening/closing transactions
 Cursor: 
  - Irregular meaning of 0 for fetch/move no longer used
  - Added Fetch() and Move()
  - Fixed "done" accounting in SetCount()
  - Separated creation of FETCH command into MakeFetchCmd() method
 Transaction:
  - Added MakeEmpty()
 Util:
  - Added Result_size_type_max
