Connections
(*) Support scoped/unscoped non-superuser identity (outside transaction only)

Exceptions
(*) Document exception guarantees (weak / strong / poorly defined / pure)

Results
(*) Real encoding support (PQmblen(), PQenv2encoding())
(*) Conceive metadata model

(*) Provide metadata information in tablestream
(*) Can we have a tablestream that looks more like a result?

(*) Streambuffer class?

Tests
