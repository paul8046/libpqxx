HIGH-PRIORITY
(*) Add "private" include directory
(*) Thread synchronization
(*) Rename trigger

All over
(*) Add gcc's deprecated attribute to deprecated functions
(*) Can gcc's const function attribute be useful anywhere?  It's VERY strict.
(*) Use gcc's malloc attribute ("pointer not aliased after return")
(*) Use gcc's nonnull attribute for non-null pointer parameters
(*) Use gcc's noreturn attribute for non-returning functions
(*) Use gcc's pure function attribute
(*) Give private functions "internal" visibility where possible

Build & Configuration
(*) Move PGHOST guessing logic from tools/preprelease to Makefile.am?
(*) Make test suite install to a temporary directory & build a test program

Connections
(*) Support scoped/unscoped non-superuser identity (outside transaction only)
(*) libpqxx-level trace output
(*) Factor out "connection policy" hierarchy

Documentation
(*) Use @c to mark code in Doxygen comments
(*) Move most of README over to some more powerful format (Doxygen?)

Exceptions
(*) Strip newlines from PostgreSQL error messages in exceptions?
(*) Document exception guarantees (weak / strong / poorly defined / pure)

Large Objects
(*) Check for correct handling of nul characters
(*) Check out new 64-bit API that's being contributed

Results
(*) Convert to/from date/time values
(*) Splice out a reusable interface definition
(*) Real encoding support (PQmblen(), PQenv2encoding())
(*) Check for correct handling of nul characters
(*) Support PQftablecol()
(*) Support new PQcancel() and friends
(*) Conceive metadata model

Streams
(*) Provide metadata information in tablestream
(*) Can we have a tablestream that looks more like a result?
(*) Create "inserter" class for column lists
(*) Allow single-level insertion with endt/endr manipulators
(*) Streambuffer class?

Tests
(*) Test broken connections
(*) Test tablereader and rows ending in empty fields

Thread-safety
(*) Guard against race bugs by marking "last modification" of objects
(*) User-definable locking primitive set

Transactions
(*) User schema support for robusttransaction log table
(*) Support SET CONSTRAINTS (no-op for nontransaction).  Make DEFER scoped?
(*) Support constraints definition
(*) Pipelined operation for high-level classes: cursor, tablestream, ...

Util
(*) Report closing of non-open sessionfocus only during explicit close, not dtor
(*) Support floating-point infinities
