# Common options for Visual C++ makefiles to build libpqxx and its regression

# Standard library namespace.  There are only two reasons why you might want to
# change this: 1. your compiler doesn't define the standard library in the "std"
# namespace, in which case PGSTD should be the empty string (but a compiler with
# that problem is not likely to be good enough to compile libpqxx); or 2. you
# are using a third-party standard library implementation such as STLport, which
# lives in another namespace to avoid clashes with the implementation that came
# with the compiler.  In the latter case, PGSTD must be set to the namespace
# used by your preferred implementation.
# In all other cases, just leave this set to "std".
STD=/D "PGSTD=std"

# If you are using a 3rd party STL like STLport, remember to check your path
# and be sure the STLport is included before the MSVC includes. VCVARS32.BAT
# doesn't know anything about the directories as defined in the IDE. I use
# set INCLUDE=\Utility\Code\STLport-4.5\stlport;%INCLUDE%
# STD=/D "PGSTD=_STL" 

# Depending on your STL library min/max need to be defined.  Using STLport
# there is no need for libpqxx to redefine these for me.

# The next line gives us the src directory to add additional include directories
# We need certain header files from the Postgres code.  Specifically 
#
#	postgres_ext.h (in src/include in the PostgreSQL source tree)
#	libpq-fe.h (in src/interfaces/libpq in the PostgreSQL source tree)
#
# This directory is also used to find the compiled libpq and libpqd.
PGSQLSRC=D:\Src\postgresql-8.1.3\src

# We should use the libpq libraries that correspond to the source tree whose
# headers we are including.  This ensures that we find all in the same place:
LIBPATH=/libpath:"$(PGSQLSRC)/interfaces/libpq/Release" /libpath:"$(PGSQLSRC)/interfaces/libpq/Debug"
